# Deep-AutoQC
Image classification for the ENIGMA HALFpipe project at Charit√©  using deep learning - BA Thesis
DeepAutoQC aims to assist researchers in classifying skull strip reports as either usable (good) or unusable (bad).

## Usage
The code in this project can be used by running either `train.py` script or `test.py` script within the command line.
First of all, you should go to `args.py` and
## For Training
* set the `DATA_PATH` constant to a folder only containing corresponding t1w.nii(.gz), mask.nii(.gz) files as this is required for a training run
* specify the hyperparameters used in training.
* set `EARLYSTOP_PATH` to your desired location where model_weights, optimizer_weights and more parameters will be saved

Then, run `python3 train.py` to start your training process. The progress is logged on the command line.

## Using multiple GPUs
You can enable multiple GPUs for training by setting `n_gpus` in `args.py`. If `n_gpus` is set to a value not available on your machine the function `device_preparation` will set `torch.device` to either `"cpu"` or `"cuda"` using all available GPUs.

## Resume Training
You can resume training from a previously saved checkpoint by:
`python train.py -r ckpt/path`

## For Predictions
* check the `ckpts/` folder and set `MODEL_CKPT` to your desired `*model.pt` which will be loaded for predictions

Then, run `python3 test.py [-h] -i INPUT`. Remember `the following arguments are required: -i/--input` should contain the path to your svg file.
Check `predictions` folder for your output.
